description: |
  A smart contract developer in the Polkadot ecosystem specializes in creating decentralized
  applications (dApps) and contracts using ink!, a Rust-based eDSL for writing Wasm smart
  contracts specifically designed for the Polkadot network. This developer would have a strong
  background in Rust programming, as ink! leverages Rust's type safety and memory efficiency to
  ensure that the smart contracts are secure and performant.

  The role involves designing, coding, testing, and deploying smart contracts on blockchains built
  with Substrate, which are capable of connecting to the Polkadot relay chain. The developer needs
  to be knowledgeable about the unique aspects of the Polkadot ecosystem, such as its shared
  security model, cross-chain interoperability, and the specific standards and protocols used for
  contract interactions.

  Moreover, they should be adept at understanding the economic and game-theoretic implications of
  contract design to ensure that the contracts are not only technically robust but also
  economically sound.
